            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is a quick and easy recipe for when I'm in the rush but craving something savory. Which is always. I can't have peanut butter so I sub with <em>sunflower butter</em>, but if you lack peanut allergies unlike me feel free to use PB.</p>

            <p id="serving"><em>Makes one serving.</em></p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul class="ingredients-list">
                <li>3 tbsp sunflower butter</li>
                <li>1-2 tbsp gochujang</li>
                <li>1 tbsp honey</li>
                <li>1 tsp rice vinegar</li>
                <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
                <li>1 tsp of sesame oil</li>
                <li>6 oz of noodles of your choice</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>sub with garlic powder</em></li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol class="steps">
                <li>Cook your noodles per package instructions. Start boiling the water now if needed, so while you wait you can go on to step 2.</li>
                <li>In a bowl (how about the one you'll eat out of - if you're lazy about dishes such as yours truly) mix the rest of the ingredients. The non-noodle ones. Add and subtract according to taste.</li>
                <li>Once your noodles are cooked, here's a pro tip! Rinse them with cold water or throw in some ice cubes <em>immediately after straining them from the hot water</em>. This gives them a nice chewy texture.</li>
                <li>Throw them into the bowl with your sauce mix. <em>Optional:</em> Garnish them with chopped green onions, furikake, cucumber slices and maybe some kimchi. Up to you.</li>
                <li><em>Enjoy!</em></li>
            </ol>
