        <p><em>Serves 4.</em></p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>14 oz of rice noodles</li>
            <li>1-2 lbs of protein of your choice</li>
            <li>4 oz tofu</li>
            <li>2 tbsp of neutral oil</li>
            <li>vegetables:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>1 red onion or 1/4 cup chopped shallot</li>
                <li>2 tbsp pickled radish (use less if yours is strong)</li>
                <li>1 bunch of green onions</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
                <li>2 cups bean sprouts</li>
            </ul>
            <li><em>For Sauce:</em></li>
            <ul>
                <li>3-4 tbsp of palm sugar</li>
                <li>3 tbsp water</li>
                <li>3-5 tbsp tamarind paste</li>
                <li>2 tbsp fish sauce <em>(sub with soy sauce)</em></li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak the rice noodles in warm water for at least an hour.</li>
            <li>While the noodles soak, prep all the vegetables by washing, slicing and/or dicing them. Mince the shallots and garlic.</li>
            <li>Prepare the sauce! Start by melting the palm sugar in a bowl (microwave or stove). Then, add in the tamarind paste, water and fish sauce. Adjust to taste.</li>
            <li>Throw the oil into a pan and start cooking the protein until mostly cooked through (about 80%).</li>
            <li>Add in the tofu, shallots/onions and garlic and any other vegetables and continue stir frying until tender (about 3 min).</li>
            <li>Add in noodles and sauce and mix and stir fry for another 5 min. Add sauce if it starts to be too dry (not too much though!). Until it looks right. You can add in chili flakes if you like.</li>
            <li>Serve it, be as fancy or unfancy as you need. <em>Enjoy!</em></li>
        </ol>
